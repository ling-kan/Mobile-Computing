# Mobile-Computing

This module provides students with knowledge in the specification and development of connected
‘data-driven’ mobile applications, using industry standard tools and guidelines. Mobile device
platforms – smartphones - provide a rich development experience with direct access to a number of
pervasive sensors such as GPS, camera, proximity, NFC and multiple network connectivity channels.
These sensors are used as building blocks for lifestyle-supporting mobile applications in areas such
as health, fitness, social, science, and entertainment. Such applications are now seen as part of the
everyday fabric of life. Students will learn how to develop topically-themed native mobile applications
that consume RESTful web services. Data privacy and security issues are discussed throughout the
module.


i) Theory
• design and specification guidelines for applications on resource constrained mobile devices;
• understanding the ethical, privacy, and security implications of mobile application data stored
locally and online;
• identity and authentication
ii) Development
• Development of native mobile applications based on a topical theme
• connecting to RESTful web services to consume and display data
• implementation of suitable mobile data storage techniques
